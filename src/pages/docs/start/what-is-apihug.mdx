## Why should I use ApiHug?

ApiHug is user-friendly, design driven ,straightforward and satisfying.

ApiHug revolutionizes the separation of API design and implementation by adopting a domain-specific language (DSL) and employing object-oriented methods to design and define API components. This approach significantly enhances API reusability.

ApiHug leverages git for API management and utilizes repositories for API distribution. By building upon existing systems and frameworks, ApiHug completely transforms the paradigm of API development and management.

### Key features:

- Effortless Visual API Design with IDEA plugin integration.
- Object-oriented(Domain specific language) approach for highly reusable API design.
- Compliance with OAS design standards for industry best practices.
- Design, test & implementation in one platform
- Integration exist CI/CD's facilities
- Base mature toolchains(gradle) & IDEs(IDEA) & framework(Spring)

## What is ApiHug used for?

### API Design

ApiHug is a design-first platform that follow the standard [OAS(3.1.0)](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html), it introduces Common Language (DSL) to bridge the gap between:

- Domain Experts
- Technical Experts
- Working Software & Tests
- 3rd party Partners

With its intuitive interface, ApiHug empowers the complete API design lifecycle.

### API Implement

Accelerate your development Converting your APIs into Software Artifacts:

- API Definitions Meta
- Application Framework Backend(SpringBoot/Cloud)
- Tool Chain: Gradle + IDEA Plugin

### API Management

ApiHug revolutionizes API management by bringing the common project management concept to the API full lifecycle management. With native Git support, it simplifies version control and enables users to seamlessly design, document, mock, test, and share APIs.

The collaboration features facilitate efficient teamwork, allowing teams to easily collaborate and share their work in a streamlined manner.

### API Distribution

Distributing different versions of APIs has always been a challenge in API management.

ApiHug tackles this issue by leveraging existing package distribution mechanisms, such as Maven repository (similar to Node.js npm), to ensure a more robust and controllable API distribution process.

### API Integration

API design and implementation typically focus on solutions for API providers. However, ultimately, APIs need to be consumed by API consumers.

ApiHug offers a solution for API consumer clients. The API distribution mechanism ensures synchronization of different API versions. Additionally, API integration enables automatic generation of client-side stub code.
