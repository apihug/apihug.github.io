`Stub` used to generate the template implement code, and 3rd party dependencies integrated.

## Setup

Please refer to [apihug-full-demo demo-user/build.gradle](https://github.com/apihug/apihug-full-demo/blob/main/demo-user/build.gradle):

```groovy
plugins {
    id "java"
    alias(libs.plugins.springBoot)
    alias(libs.plugins.springDependency)
    alias(libs.plugins.hopeStub)
    alias(libs.plugins.liquibase)

}

hopeStub {
    debug = false
}
```

Meta information [apihug-full-demo demo-user/hope-stub.json](https://github.com/apihug/apihug-full-demo/blob/main/demo-user/src/main/resources/hope-stub.json):

Meta configuration `resources\hope-stub.json`:

1. Self-service Protocol Definition Dependencies: In the `proto` configuration, define dependencies for a single self-service protocol.
2. Third-party Service Protocol Definition Dependencies: In the `dependencies`, understand as dependencies on other microservices, which can be multiple.
3. Artifact Section: If dependencies have already been introduced in various ways through dependencies in your own `build.gradle`, this section is not necessary. Incorrect configurations can lead to compilation errors and may cause runtime errors! ⚠️⚠️⚠️
   1. The dependencies of the service protocol `proto` package can be controlled through standard Gradle dependencies. 
   2. Dependencies can also be managed by configuring in the `resources\hope-stub.json` file, and the plugin will handle it for you. 
   3. Maintain a unified approach and avoid mixing usage, as this can make problem location troublesome.

## Run

Every Auto generated project include a detail `README` example: [README](https://github.com/apihug/apihug-full-demo/blob/main/README.md), include detail instruction how to use it.

NOT like  [Wire](./gradle-wire.md) which integrate with gradle's default compile task, **stub** must run manually as you manually trigger it: 

```shell
sh gradlew {YOUR_MODULE}:clean stub build -x test -x stubTest
```
