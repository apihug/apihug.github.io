ApiHug's ApiSmart communicates with large language model (LLM) vendors using [Langchain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/); therefore, essentially any vendor supported by Langchain4j can be supported by ApiSmart;

However, due to our current limited capabilities, we need to add and test them one by one, which will take some time;

Ultimately, all these vendors will be able to enter our support list.

The ApiSmart editor (input box) has extended the functionality of `Markdown`:

- Supports `/` to trigger prompt autocompletion with one click; such as built-in: `/explain`, `/api`, etc.
- `file:` opens the file selector;
- ...


## Toolwindow

The Toolwindow on the right side can be opened or closed at any time and includes three parts:

- The top toolbar button menu: Restart session, open configuration, open standalone panel
- Service provider and model list selection
- Main dialogue chat panel
- Input box and send button

## Dialogue Panel

The dialogue panel follows the mainstream chat mode, where users ask questions and AI responds:

- Supports markdown rendering
- Project file links
- Prompt links and view collapse method
- Code Block custom operations
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Insert into the current editor position (automatically ignored if no file is open)
- Delete conversation

## Main Editor

If you find the Toolwindow too cramped, you can choose to open a standalone window from the toolbar at the top of the Toolwindow;

It has the exact same functionality as the Toolwindow, but with a more spacious interface.


## Editor Menu

<img src={require('@/img/editor/052_api_smart_ask.gif').default.src} alt="ApiSmart Menu" width={2378} height={1612}
     className="rounded-lg"/>

In any editor, right-clicking the menu will invoke the `Ask` feature to send your query to the Toolwindow, allowing you to continue your enjoyable AI conversation.
