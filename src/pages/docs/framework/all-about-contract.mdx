title: Why Contract is so important no only inner but also external
description: How ApiHug design use the contract to eliminate the gap inner and external

import { TipInfo } from '@/components/Tip'


## Basic

<TipInfo>
  Why contract is so import in internal or external communication?
</TipInfo>

Basically what ApiHug try to solve is API, which is a specification use to communication between different layers or systems. 

In other words, it is a contract:

1. internal an application, it used to communicate between the backend and front-end
2. external, between different applications(microservices) or 3rd-party system


## ApiHug

1. ApiHug implements API design strictly according to Swagger standardsï¼›
2. ApiHug use DSL to define the contract supplier, which will leverage the most compile time static check avoid human mistake and readability
3. For 3rd party system dependencies also use DSL definition
4. ApiHug test [Kola](/docs/kola) strictly according to the api design proto
5. ApiHug [MCP](/docs/mcp/001_start) expose the MCP endpoints 

All those build base on ApiHug's Api design meta language: protobuf

During the compile and runtime you can customize this behaviour easily with `hope.common.service.contract.ContractAdapter`

it will supply those extension for customized:


| function          | Remarks                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `moduleClassName` | class name of this application's proto module.                                          |
| `contract`        | Control the api context from the given 3rd-party module(microservice api dependencies). |
| `mcp`             | Control the expose of MCP service base on API.                                          |
