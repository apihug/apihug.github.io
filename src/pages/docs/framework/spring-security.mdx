import { TipInfo } from '@/components/Tip'

The security framework provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks.

**ApiHug** offers a minimalist and efficient security solution, different from traditional frameworks like Apache Shiro or Spring Security.

It is still based on resource (API) permission management, combined with roles, creating a very simple RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) structure that is ready to use out of the box.

## Protocol

How to define the protocol at the Proto layer: [Minimal Authentication & Authorization](/docs/framework/widget/authority)

## Implementation

1. SecurityAspect: Aspect
2. SecurityContext: Runtime security context, including resource to CheckerAuthorization mapping
3. HopeSecurityManager: Runtime security parameter assembly
4. JWTFilter: JWT filter

Currently, the **Aspect** SecurityAspect only supports **BEFORE** checks, meaning it validates before entering the resource (API) business logic.

### Configuration

Configuration path: `hope.security`; Configuration object: `HopeSecurityProperties`.
