## Background

During deep development of our projects, there are always some requirements that are hard to categorize clearly. Solving them using traditional methods can be tricky, but sometimes a different perspective makes the solution straightforward.

The built-in mini-plugins in Apihug are designed exactly for solving these small issues. With each new version of the IDEA plugin, they will bring you little surprises and small joys during daily development ‚Äî hopefully adding some fun to your everyday coding experience.

HOP: Health-oriented programming :-)


## `hope.optional`

### Overview

This plugin introduces support for Maven-style **optional dependencies** by creating a new configuration
named `optional`. Dependencies added to this configuration are included in the project‚Äôs **compile** and **runtime
classpaths**, but they do **not propagate** to dependent projects.

This behavior is particularly useful when you want to include certain dependencies for internal use without forcing
downstream consumers to include them unnecessarily.

### Usage

When using the shared template file [`spring.lib.gradle`](../gradle/spring.lib.gradle), apply the plugin as follows:

```groovy
apply plugin: "hope.optional"
//or use it standalone:
//id "hope.optional"

optional(libs.spring.context)
```

### Origin

This concept was inspired by Spring Framework‚Äôs implementation:
[OptionalDependenciesPlugin](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/java/org/springframework/build/optional/OptionalDependenciesPlugin.java)

## `hope.router`

### Overview

This plugin automates the generation of **frontend routing structures** by scanning the source files in a
designated `pages` directory.

It eliminates the need for manual route configuration by detecting page components and dynamically generating a
structured routing file (e.g., `router.js` or `routes.ts`) based on the folder hierarchy.

### Documentation

For usage examples and detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the frontend documentation:

üëâ [Vue Router Integration Guide](https://apihug.github.io/docs/ui/002_vue#router)

Sure! Here's an optimized version of your text while preserving the original style and meaning:

## `hope.rename`

This plugin helps rename package names. As Apihug maintains consistency between proto and implementation package
names,  
renaming packages can be a painful process. This plugin aims to relieve that burden.

- `-DpkgRename` ‚Äì Specifies how to rename the package from old to new; format: `{old}-{new}`  
Example: `-DpkgRename="com.abc-com.xyz"`
- `-DskipModules` ‚Äì Comma-separated list of modules to skip  
Example: `-DskipModules="module-a,module-b"`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This plugin makes significant changes. Please **BACK UP** your project before execution.The results may still require some manual adjustments to ensure full consistency.
