title: ApiHug UI Solution
description: Semantic design for frontend and backend, saving over 80% of development time
---

## Background

Modern frontend frameworks are increasingly adopting the SPA (Single Page Application) approach, which presents challenges for frontend-backend collaboration. ApiHug aims to reduce the complexity of multi-person collaboration and the lag in synchronization. To achieve this, we have implemented:

1. Frontend and backend projects in different submodules within the same project
2. Toolchain integration: `gradle` + `vite`, seamless integration with mutual task invocation
3. Runtime: Java application static proxy + Vue proxy

This approach maximizes team collaboration, minimizes context switching, and optimizes development efficiency!

This new development approach is not pioneered by ApiHug. Earlier projects like [Jhipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) have already attempted this, and ApiHug has drawn much inspiration from Jhipster.

ApiHug tightly revolves around the Open API standard, using DSL as a common language between different roles, making this transition exceptionally smooth!

Below, we'll guide you through how to use ApiHug for rapid and elegant full-stack development, from the protocol layer to the application layer, and finally to the UI layer!
