# Upgrade Guide: SDK 1.3.8-RELEASE & Plugin 0.7.1

## Overview

This guide outlines important changes and migration steps when upgrading to **SDK 1.3.8-RELEASE** and **Plugin 0.7.1**.

<TipGood>
  This release upgrades the version management system to use a new style `toml` and 
  updates the plugin project templates accordingly.
</TipGood>

After upgrading either component, you may experience build issues due to these structural changes. If your project fails to build, please follow the guidance below to resolve compatibility issues.

## Issue: Missing `springBootVersion` Property

### Symptom

During execution of the `wire` task, you may encounter an error similar to the following:

```
Script 'jar:file:/.../...it-plugin-wire-1.3.8-RELEASE.jar!/wire-shared.gradle' line: 44

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating script.
> Could not get unknown property 'springBootVersion' for object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler.
```

### Solution

To resolve this issue, update your `build.gradle` file by adding the following block to define `springBootVersion` using the value from the `libs.versions.toml` file:

```groovy
// Read Spring Boot version from libs.versions.toml and set as ext property
ext {
    springBootVersion = libs.versions.springBootVersion.get()
}
```

Note: The actual value of `libs.versions.springBootVersion` depends on your configuration in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Please ensure it's correctly defined.


## Why This Change?

We've updated the naming convention used in the `libs.versions.toml` file to align with common Gradle practices.

Previously, dependencies were defined using **camelCase** keys:

```toml
springBootStarterWeb = { group = "org.springframework.boot", name = "spring-boot-starter-web" }
```

Which was referenced like this:

```groovy
implementation(libs.springBootStarterWeb)
```

However, the standard and more maintainable format in Gradle Version Catalogs uses **kebab-case**:

```toml
spring-boot-starter-web = { group = "org.springframework.boot", name = "spring-boot-starter-web" }
```

Which is accessed using nested syntax:

```groovy
implementation(libs.spring.boot.starter.web)
```

As part of this upgrade, we have standardized all dependency definitions to use kebab-case for consistency and better alignment with Gradle best practices.

For further assistance or if you encounter additional issues during the upgrade, please consult the full migration documentation or reach out to our support team.
