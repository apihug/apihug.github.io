title: Protocol Buffers AS OAS DSL
description: Use Protocol Buffers as DSL to define OAS(Open API Specification
---

## Basic

[The OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) target for:

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs. This allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic.

Similar to what interface descriptions have done for **lower-level programming**, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

When it comes to interface descriptions for lower-level programming, we use a concept called **IDL** (Interface Definition Language). For example, Protocol Buffers and Apache Thrift fall into the category of IDL.

To establish a common language for OpenAPI definition, we can combine DSL and IDL, enabling concise syntax and language-agnostic interfaces for interoperability across programming languages and frameworks. This fosters collaboration and seamless API design and consumption.

## ApiHug

ApiHug has made further advancements in integration and innovation, making the entire process more robust and easily adaptable for engineering purposes. It offers a comprehensive DSL design specifically catering to OpenAPI, a complete toolchain, and seamless integration with modern enterprise development, resulting in efficient and streamlined API development.

[ApiHug Proto for OAS](https://github.com/apihug/apihug-proto/) define extension to support OAS standard.

Example [API Definition](https://github.com/apihug/apihug-full-demo/blob/main/demo-user-proto/src/main/proto/com/apihug/demo/user/proto/api/admin/api.proto):

```protobuf
service UserAdminService {
  option (hope.swagger.svc) = {
    path: "/user/admin";
    description: "User admin server";
  };

  rpc SayHello (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
    option (hope.swagger.operation) = {
      get: "/say-hello";
      description: "Hello from the user admin server";
      tags: "project";
      priority: MIDDLE;
      authorization:{
        low_limit_risky_mode: ANONYMOUS
      }
    };
  };


  rpc RegisterCustomer (com.apihug.demo.user.proto.api.admin.request.RegisterRequest) returns (com.apihug.demo.user.proto.api.admin.response.CustomerRegisteredResponse) {
    option (hope.swagger.operation) = {
      post: "/register";
      description: "admin try to register a new customer";
      priority: CRITICAL;
      authorization:{
        rbac:{
          authorities: ["USER_ADD"];
        }
      }
    };
  }
  
  rpc ChangePassword (com.apihug.demo.user.proto.api.admin.request.ChangePasswordRequest) returns (com.apihug.demo.user.proto.api.admin.response.CustomerPasswordUpdatedResponse) {
    option (hope.swagger.operation) = {
      post: "/change-password";
      description: "use to reset the password after password forgot";
      priority: HIGH;
      authorization:{
        rbac:{
          authorities: ["USER_ADD", "USER_DELETE"];
        }
      }
    };
  }
}
```
