> The critical complexity of most software projects is in understanding the domain itself.
> By Eric Evans in Domain-Driven Design

Being easy to understand should be the gold standard of good and maintainable software.

Domain Specific Language(Common Language) closes the gap between:

- Domain Experts
- Technical Experts
- Working Software & Tests

ApiHug aims to bridge the gap between various stakeholders involved in API development, including Business Analysts, Project Managers, Architects, UI designers, and Testers.
It achieves this by providing a common language for defining APIs that transcends specific formats like Swagger's JSON/YAML or programming languages like Java and Python.

ApiHug's goal is to facilitate effective communication and collaboration among diverse team members, ensuring a shared understanding and streamlined development process.
